<b>"MERN" is an acronym that stands for:</b>

<b><b></b> </b>  MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's often used in MERN stack applications as the database layer due to its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use with JavaScript-based applications.

<b>Express.js:</b>  Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. In the MERN stack, Express.js is used to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and interact with databases like MongoDB.

<b>React.js:</b> React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It's a key component of the MERN stack, serving as the frontend framework for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state.

<b>Node.js:</b> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling them to build scalable and high-performance web applications. In the MERN stack, Node.js is used as the backend runtime environment for running the Express.js server and handling server-side logic.

The MERN stack combines these four technologies to create full-stack web applications where MongoDB serves as the database, Express.js handles server-side logic and routing, React.js manages the frontend user interface, and Node.js provides the runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server-side.

<h1>Activities</h1>
<strong>Day 1:</strong> How website works <br>
<strong>Day 2:</strong> API, Status Code, HTTP Verbs (postman)
<h1>Step 1: Learning NodeJs[From Day 3 to </h1>
  I) Installing Node then 'npm init' -> add package.json <br>
  II) Basic of JS:<br>
        i) forEach & for in loop <br>
  III) Installing Express -> .get and .listen - listners
  IV) Installing nodemon -> to automate the node app.js -> npm start
  V) Installing mongoose -> to use MongoDB -> It acts as a mediater bet MongoDB and user
        i) connecting MongoDB database ->then saving to a database folder -> to import in future
        
  VI) Creating Schema -> Model -> importing for future
